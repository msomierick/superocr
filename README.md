# Super OCR

This is a Flask project which extracts OCR(Optical Character Recognition) data and Exif
(Exchangeable image file format) data from uploaded images.

Users upload the images and the data is returned as a JSON response.

It uses [Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to recognise and read the text embedded in images, a form of optical character recognition (OCR).
